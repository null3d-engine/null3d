# Implementation notes

This guide holds lessons from building the engine: habits that keep the hot paths fast, and the browser faults that shaped the code. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) holds the hard rules that these notes serve.

## Hot paths without allocation

The engine's hot paths stay allocation-free with these habits (hard rule 1):

- Read typed arrays by index rather than by destructuring.
- Reuse WebGPU descriptors (`RenderPassSetup` and `submitOne` in `packages/engine/src/gpu/webgpu/reusable.ts`).
- Pass typed arrays straight to WebGPU, as `setBindGroup` reads dynamic offsets from the draw list.
- Keep reused lists at a fixed length.
- Do not wrap browser promises in `async` functions, and use `Math.sqrt` rather than `Math.hypot`.
- Keep closures out of functions that run every frame, even in a branch that rarely runs. Until the browser optimizes such a function, it allocates the variables a closure captures on every call.

## Allocation in Rust

- Rust tests that count allocations use `null3d_core::testing::CountingAllocator`, from the core crate's `testing` feature. It counts only the threads a test marks, so the test runner's own threads cannot reach the count.
- The frame recorder sizes a frame's upload arena for the most that any frame can copy for the scene as it stands. It keeps its layout tables and scratch space between rebuilds. Only the frames right after the scene grows allocate.
- Pipelined frames keep one arena per frame parity, so the allocation tests change the structure on both parities after warm-up.

## Uploads

- Uploads from 64 KiB to 4 MiB take the route that the render worker measures as faster on the device: `queue.writeBuffer` or the staging ring.
- In Chrome on a Mac the ring is 3 to 6 times faster in that range, as `writeBuffer` takes up to 0.8 ms per MB. In Safari `writeBuffer` wins at every size, because unmapping a staging buffer costs time in proportion to its size. Outside that range `writeBuffer` wins in every browser measured.

## Download size

- The page and the sketch worker load the renderer and the GPU layer (`render/draw.ts`) with a dynamic import, only in the modes where they draw. A pipelined page then downloads the GPU layer once, in the render worker.
- In their other modules, import only types from the renderer and the GPU layer: a value import bundles the GPU layer into their files again.
- The sketch worker starts the import with its other startup work. The page starts it once the core has downloaded. An earlier start slowed the core's download on Slow 4G and delayed the first frame by 22 to 37 ms.

## Threads and shared memory

- A job worker without work blocks its thread in a wait (hard rule 5). When Safari stops a thread inside such a wait, it keeps the thread's shared memory until the tab closes, even across reloads. The engine therefore ends the job workers' loops before it stops them, and `destroy()` resolves once they have stopped.
- The single-threaded build's core runs on the page. The page keeps it for the next engine, and `destroyEngine` empties it when an engine stops.

## Browser faults

- Safari 26 drops a whole submit if its commands hold two or more copies from one buffer that was mapped when they were recorded. WebGPU allows that, and Chrome and Firefox accept it. The staging ring therefore records a frame's copies after it unmaps the buffer, just before the frame's next command.
- The uploads test page reports each frame's WebGPU errors, which show such a failure.
- Work around a browser's fault with an order or a call that is valid everywhere, as the staging ring does. Where browsers differ in speed, time the choices on the device, as the upload routes do. When neither works, detect the fault with a feature test, never from the user agent (hard rule 14).
