// One picture test per species of the vegetation add-on's plant core, made from the species folders,
// so a species adds its folder and its references and no line of the manifest. Each test, plant-<id>,
// draws one 1024 by 1024 frame of four panels from the plant review sketch: the whole plant at a
// turn of 30 degrees, a close view of the crown, a leaf-cluster cutting and the bark at mid height.
// `bun run check` refuses a test without its references, so a species lands with its pictures.
